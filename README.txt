Hello and welcome to the README file of Alablaster!

This game was a project for our INF 391 class and it is a game where you play as a marble and roll around the map to get all of the collectable items before you can move on to the next level. Each level has a timer that runs until you have collected all of the items and reached the finish. Our game was inspired by the game Super Monkey Ball and other similar arcade games.

Aidan's role in this project was organizing the group along with assisting in coding and modeling for content that was cut, Jake's role in this project was programming and creating level designs, Hailey's role in this project was to create music, and Amanda's role in this project was to create textures and the UV maps for models.

We hope you have fun playing our project!
